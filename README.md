# Used-Car-Price-Prediction

Predicting the prices of used cars using machine learning techniques. This project involves data collection from various sources, preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset, exploratory data analysis to understand key insights, feature engineering to enhance model performance, and model selection to identify the best algorithm for price prediction. Evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) are used to assess model performance. The trained model can be deployed for practical use, allowing users to input car details and receive accurate price predictions.
